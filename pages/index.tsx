          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            I'm a digital marketer.
            <br />
            Originally from Italy, currently in Ireland.
            <br />
            Iâ€™m an avid reader, dog lover and travel obsessed.
            <br />
            I'm highly organised. I write things and develop plans.
            <br />
            I'm good with numbers, but in love with colors.
            <br />A glass of prosecco, few friends and deep conversations is my
            idea of happiness.
          </p>
