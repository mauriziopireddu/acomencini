        <Heading>Hi, I'm Alessandra.</Heading>
        <p>
          I'm a digital marketer.
          <br />
          Originally from Italy, currently in Ireland.
          <br />
          Iâ€™m an avid reader, dog lover and travel obsessed.
          <br />
          I'm highly organised. I write things and develop plans.
          <br />
          I'm good with numbers, but in love with colors.
          <br />A glass of prosecco, few friends and deep conversations is my
          idea of happiness.
        </p>
